interface MatchmakingState {
  isSearching: boolean;
  status: string;
  region?: string;
  gameMode: 'ffa' | 'teams' | 'battle-royale';
  skillLevel: number;
}
Implement user authentication
// Not implemented:
- Login/Registration system
- Session management
- Profile persistence
Add leaderboard persistence
// Current leaderboard is in-memory only
- Database integration needed
- Historical stats tracking
- Achievement system
Finishing the game mechanics
